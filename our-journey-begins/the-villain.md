# The Villain

A villain (also known as a "[black hat](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/black\_hat)" or "bad guy"; the [feminine form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminine\_form) is villainess) is a [stock character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock\_character), whether based on a historical narrative or one of [literary fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary\_fiction). [_Random House Unabridged Dictionary_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random\_House\_Webster's\_Unabridged\_Dictionary) defines such a character as "a [cruelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty) [malicious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malice\_\(law\)) person who is involved in or devoted to [wickedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickedness) or [crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime); scoundrel; or a character in a [play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play\_\(theatre\)), [novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel), or the like, who constitutes an important [evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil) [agency](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agency) in the plot".[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain#cite\_note-1) The [antonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonym) of a villain is a [hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero).

The villain's structural purpose is to serve as the opposition of the hero character and their motives or evil actions drive a plot along.\[[_citation needed_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed)][\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain#cite\_note-2) In contrast to the hero, who is defined by feats of ingenuity and [bravery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravery) and the pursuit of [justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice) and the greater good, a villain is often defined by their acts of selfishness, evilness, arrogance, cruelty, and [cunning](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cunning), displaying [immoral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immorality) behavior that can oppose or pervert [justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice).

#### Etymology

The term _villain_ first came into [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English\_language) from the [Anglo-French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Norman\_language) and [Old French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old\_French) _vilain_, which is further derived from the [Late Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late\_Latin) word _villanus_,[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain#cite\_note-3) which referred to those bound to the soil of the [villa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa) and worked on an equivalent of a [plantation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation) in [Late Antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late\_Antiquity), in [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) or [Gaul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaul).

_Vilain_ later shifted to [_villein_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villein),[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain#cite\_note-5) which referred to a person of a less than knightly status, implying a lack of [chivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalry) and [politeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politeness). All actions that were unchivalrous or evil (such as [treachery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betrayal) or [rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape)) eventually fell under the identity of belonging to a villain in the modern sense of the word. Additionally, _villein_ became used as a term of [abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse) and eventually took on its modern meaning.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain#cite\_note-6)

The landed aristocracy of Middle Age Europe used politically and linguistically the Middle English descendant of _villanus_ meaning "villager" (styled as _vilain_ or _vilein_) with the meaning "a person of uncouth mind and manners". As the common equating of manners with morals gained in strength and currency, the connotations worsened, so that the modern word _villain_ is no unpolished villager, but is instead (among other things) a deliberate scoundrel or criminal.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain#cite\_note-7)

At the very same time the medieval expression "vilein" or "vilain" is closely influenced by the word "vile", referring to something wicked or worthless. From the late 13th-century _vile_ meant "morally repugnant; morally flawed, corrupt, wicked; of no value; of inferior quality; disgusting, foul, ugly; degrading, humiliating; of low estate, without worldly honor or esteem", from Anglo-French _ville_, Old French _vil_, from Latin _vilis_ "cheap, worthless, of low value".[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain#cite\_note-8) Although the relation of these terms became intertwined at some later in time, it is unknown when this happened.

#### Classical Literature

In classical literature, the villain character is not always the same as those that appear in modern and postmodern incarnations, as the lines of morality are often blurred to imply a sense of [ambiguity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity) or affected by historical context and cultural ideas. Often the delineation of heroes and villains in this literature is left unclear.

[William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William\_Shakespeare) modelled the villain [archetype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype) to be three-dimensional in characteristics and gave way to the complex nature that villains showcase in modern literature. However, Shakespeare's incarnations of historical figures were influenced by the propaganda pieces coming from Tudor sources, and his works often showed this [bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias) and discredited their reputation. For example, Shakespeare famously portrayed [Richard III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard\_III) as a hideous monster who destroyed his family out of [spite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spite\_\(sentiment\)).

#### Folk and Fairy Tales

In an analysis of Russian [fairy tales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy\_tale), [Vladimir Propp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir\_Propp) concluded that the majority of stories had only eight "[dramatis personae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatis\_personae)", one being the villain.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain#cite\_note-Propp-11): 79  This analysis has been widely applied to non-Russian tales. The actions that fell into a villain's sphere were:

* a story-initiating villainy, where the villain caused [harm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm) to the hero or his family
* a conflict between the hero and the villain, either a fight or other competition
* pursuing the hero after he has succeeded in winning the fight or obtaining something from the villain

When a character displays these traits, it is not necessarily tropes specific to the fairy tale genre, but it does imply that the one who performs certain acts to be the villain. The villain, therefore, can appear twice in a story to fulfill certain roles: once in the opening of the story, and a second time as the person sought out by the hero.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain#cite\_note-Propp-11): 84 

When a character has only performed actions or displayed traits that coincide with Vladimir Propp's analysis, that character can be identified as a pure villain. Folklore and fairy tale villains can also play a myriad of roles that can influence or drive a story forward. In fairy tales villains can perform an influential role; for example, a [witch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch) who fought the hero and ran away, and who lets the hero follow her, is also performing the task of "guidance" and thus acting as a helper.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain#cite\_note-Propp-11): 81 

Propp also proposed another two [archetypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetypes) of the villain's role within the narrative, in which they can portray themselves as villainous in a more general sense. The first is the [false hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False\_hero): This character is always villainous, presenting a false claim to be the hero that must be rebutted for the [happy ending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy\_ending).[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain#cite\_note-Propp-11): 60  Examples of characters who display this trait, and interfere with the success of a tale's hero, are the Ugly Stepsisters in [Cinderella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella) who chopped off parts of their feet to fit in the shoe.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain#cite\_note-12)

Another role for the villain would be the dispatcher, who sends the hero on their [quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest). At the beginning of the story, their request may appear benevolent or innocent, but the dispatcher's real intentions might be to send the hero on a journey in the hopes of being rid of them.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain#cite\_note-Propp-11): 77 

The roles and influences that villains can have over a narrative can also be transferred over to other characters – to continue their role in the narrative through another character. The legacy of the villain is often transferred through that of [bloodlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodline) (family) or a devoted follower. For example, if a [dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon) played the role of a villain but was killed by the hero, another character (such as the dragon's sister) might take on the legacy of the previous villain and pursue the hero out of revenge.
